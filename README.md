Basic Image Processing Application
Overview
This project implements a basic image processing application in C++. The application supports grayscale images, 
represented by a 2D array of pixels. Each pixel can take a value from 0 to 255, where 0 represents black and 255 
represents white, with values in between encoding different shades of gray.

Features
Adjust Brightness and Contrast: Modify the brightness and contrast of the image.
Correct the Overall Brightness: Correct the overall brightness of the image.
Convolutions: Apply convolution operations for various image processing tasks.
Draw a Circle: Draw a circle on the image.
Draw a Line: Draw a line on the image.
Draw a Rectangle: Draw a rectangle on the image.
